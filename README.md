Task 3: Temperature Conversion Web Application

I am pleased to announce the successful completion of Task 3: Temperature Conversion Web Application as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte. This project focused on building an interactive and user-friendly web application that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin with ease.

The application features an input field for temperature values, a dropdown menu or radio button for unit selection, a "Convert" button to trigger calculations, and a display area for the converted result. To enhance usability, input validation mechanisms were implemented to accept only numerical values and prevent errors. Additionally, the design ensures clarity and responsiveness across various devices.

This project provided valuable insights into JavaScript-based real-time calculations, interactive UI design, and input handling in web applications. It further strengthened my problem-solving skills and reinforced the importance of building user-centric applications.

üìΩÔ∏è A demonstration of the project is available below. I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback!
